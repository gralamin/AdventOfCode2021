Advent of Code for 2021

Per day, remember to:
```
export day=day02
cargo new $day
cp helloworld/Makefile $day/
touch $day/README.md
cp day01/src/filelib.rs $day/src/filelib.rs
```

By convention for this repo, so I can ignore it, all programs will be called `<foldername>.day` eg `day01.day`.

To format code, call:

```
make format
```
